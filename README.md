creating a personal website for my friend

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are concise and to the point. The more detail you provide throughout these sections will definitely help throughout the development phase. Just something to keep in mind as you continue on in your future as a web developer.

Your project and files are all set up to spec. My only comment on your code is that is missing the <head> tag as well as the <body> tag. Please refer to https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/html/ to see what should be the minimum boilerplate code on all html files. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier II. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.

## Milestone 2a Feedback

Be a little bit more verbose about what will be included in your testimonials.  Are these short quotes with attribution, or longer paragraphs?  Are there pictures associated with the testimonial?  

Make sure you differentiate the different sections of your site visually.  Your main sections are mostly a wall of text on a white background, and you should think about how you can visually make those sections more distinguishable, through something like a different background color, or a different layout.  Your menu and footer also could use a bit of visual flair to differentiate them.

Relatedly, the text within each of these components will probably be different from what's in your wireframes.  For instance, if you're thinking about having 2-4 testimonials, think about how those will be visually laid out.  Do I see all of them at a time on the page laid out vertically, or is there some kind of slider effect?

You've got a stray `>` sign in your page title.

Your milestone 2a passes at a Tier III with early submission.

## Milestone 3 Feedback

* Nice color scheme and overall design.  You're using a less-is-more look to good effect here.  The banner image at the top is both simple and effective.
* With that being stipulated, your sections could use a little bit more padding or margins.  Some of your title text or ending is jammed right up against the border of the section, and it's a little jarring.
* The image of George is very stretched horizontally.  I'd strongly suggest using an image editor to make the image square before trying to make it fit in a circle.
* It'd be nicer on the eyes and for readability if you put your bulleted list of services into 2+ columns on wider screens.
* Your contact form is broken.  Even though SendGrid integration is not complete, your website should gracefully degrade and catch the error in a more user-friendly fashion, rather than spitting out angry orange error text.
* I'd consider putting your FAQs in collapsible sections to make the site as a whole require a bit less scrolling.  It'd help reduce the "wall-of-text" feeling of that section of the site as well.
* Your git commit messages should be a little bit more verbose than they are, and they shouldn't repeat.  There's several commit messages that have the exact same message twice in a row.
* Your commits are a good number of lines.  Most of them are small enough that it's easy to understand what happes.
* There's some significant problems with mobile.
  * Your menu vanishes at small screen sizes!  The color turns black on the black bar.
  * Your main image doesn't scale and instead overflows and causes a horizontal scrollbar effect.
  * George's image gets covered by text.
* Your code could use more commenting.  There's a lot here, and some comments would provide some useful signposts to navigate what's going on.

Overall, nice work on your content, and mostly well-done on the visual aesthetic.  This is a good example of what can be done visually without being overly flashy.  Sometimes simple is best.

Your responsive implementation is really rough.  It's the biggest thing that's wrong with your site, and it's the reason your site isn't graded one Tier higher.

Your git history is good but not great.  Your commit messages shouldn't repeat, and some of your comits are on the high side with how many lines of code that a git commit should have.  That said, your code is pretty clean, and aside from the comments, is well-formatted and easy-to-read.  Attention to details like that will serve you well in development.  Nice work.

**Your overall grade for Milestone 3 is Tier II.**
