creating a personal website for my friend

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are concise and to the point. The more detail you provide throughout these sections will definitely help throughout the development phase. Just something to keep in mind as you continue on in your future as a web developer.

Your project and files are all set up to spec. My only comment on your code is that is missing the <head> tag as well as the <body> tag. Please refer to https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/html/ to see what should be the minimum boilerplate code on all html files. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier II. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.

## Milestone 2a Feedback

Be a little bit more verbose about what will be included in your testimonials.  Are these short quotes with attribution, or longer paragraphs?  Are there pictures associated with the testimonial?  

Make sure you differentiate the different sections of your site visually.  Your main sections are mostly a wall of text on a white background, and you should think about how you can visually make those sections more distinguishable, through something like a different background color, or a different layout.  Your menu and footer also could use a bit of visual flair to differentiate them.

Relatedly, the text within each of these components will probably be different from what's in your wireframes.  For instance, if you're thinking about having 2-4 testimonials, think about how those will be visually laid out.  Do I see all of them at a time on the page laid out vertically, or is there some kind of slider effect?

You've got a stray `>` sign in your page title.

Your milestone 2a passes at a Tier III with early submission.

## Milestone 2b Feedback

In addition to the short conversation at check-in here is more 2b Feedback.
The project is coming together. More content would have been nice see in development as it would have supplied the means for a better look at your layout. Nonetheless, you should now have all the tools to finish your project all the way to the end. If you have any more questions please feel free to ask the bridge for more insight.
