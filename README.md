creating a personal website for my friend

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are concise and to the point. The more detail you provide throughout these sections will definitely help throughout the development phase. Just something to keep in mind as you continue on in your future as a web developer.

Your project and files are all set up to spec. My only comment on your code is that is missing the <head> tag as well as the <body> tag. Please refer to https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/html/ to see what should be the minimum boilerplate code on all html files. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier II. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.
