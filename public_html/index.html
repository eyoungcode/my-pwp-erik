					<p><strong>
						Definition of what is an “Appraisal”
					</strong></p>
					<p>
						The process of producing a reliable, comprehensive and unbiased appraisal report. This report has
						three approaches to value, which assists the appraiser to arrive at his opinion or valuation. One of the
						methods used is the Sales comparison approach which involves finding nearby similar comparable homes and extracting
						the adjusted differences between them. The Sales comparison approach is commonly the most accurate and
						most weighted approach of the three. The next approach is the cost approach, which finds what it would cost
						to replace the improvements to the home, less the age and physical dilapidation, then adding the land
						value. The third approach to value in an appraisal report is the Income approach is a type of real estate
						appraisal method that allows investors to estimate the value of a property based on the income the property generates.
						It's used by taking the net operating income (NOI) of the rent collected and dividing it by the capitalization
						rate which determines the value of the home.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>What does an appraiser do and how can an appraiser help me?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The first thing that an appraiser does is identifying the intended users (clients) and the intended
						use (market value, liquidation value etc.) The appraiser is then expected to develop an opinion of market value,
						competently and in a manner that is objective, unbiased and impartial, because a state license
						appraiser is always in a position of public trust. That said an appraiser is a valuable person to have on your side
						to help you with pertinent financial decisions when selling your home an appraiser will help you determine the
						most appropriate price. When buying a home you can avoid overpaying, or on settling and estate or divorce
						an appraisal is the best way to ensure assets are split up evenly, So having an appraiser on your side
						will give you the confidence of always knowing the true value of homes so that you can make wise financial
						decisions
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Is the difference between an appraisal and a home inspection?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						An appraiser will not do what a professional home inspector does, nor will a home inspector do what a
						license appraiser does. An appraiser will inspect the home and observe for any visible signs of repair (broken
						windows, bad roof etc) and consider these items in the final opinion of market value, but an appraiser will not
						do a complete home inspection from roof to foundation and locate any hidden defects to evaluate the
						integrity of the structure of the property like a professional home inspector will do. A professional license appraiser
						will provide you with a reliable comprehensive and unbiased opinion of value for your home, but a
						professional home inspector will provide you a more in-depth comprehensive and detailed list of the homes current
						conditions but never the value of the home.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Is the difference between an appraisal and a BPO and or a CMA?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Many people know what an appraisal is, and they’ve heard of a CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) and a
						BPO (Broker Price Opinion) but they don’t know the difference. Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)- The CMA is performed
						by real estate agents when pricing a home for sale. It typically includes information on recently
						sold homes, current active listings, pending sales, withdrawn and cancelled listings, and expired listings. The report is focused on information that will be used to
						determine a list price for the home. Buyers agents can also do a similar CMA to determine if the home is worth
						what is being asked and so the buyer can make an informed decision. The CMA is usually a qualitative comparison because actual dollar adjustments are rarely used. This is
						not a rule, however I have never seen a CMA where adjustments were applied. In a qualitative comparison,
						features of the homes are compared to each other to arrive at a list price estimate. Agents will look at the
						different types of listings to decide what other homes like yours have sold for, how long it took to sell them,
						and the difference between the sales price the list price. All of these pieces of information will help them
						to decide on a competitive list price for your home. Broker Price Opinion (BPO)- While the CMA is done by a real estate agent to come up with a list price
						for the owner/seller, the BPO is usually ordered by a lender or bank to value a property that could be in the
						process of being foreclosed, however this is not always the. In addition, a BPO is performed when a
						foreclosure property is being listed for sale. The lender typically does not want to take the time necessary to do
						a full appraisal nor pay the fee for one. Two types of BPO’s include a drive-by and an interior inspection. The drive-by is performed as you
						might guess, by just driving by the exterior of the home while the interior would include viewing the inside. If
						the BPO is being done for foreclosure purposes then the interior inspection could reveal damage to the home and
						require estimates to repair them. If the foreclosure is being listed for sale the value could be based on a
						quick sale situation because the lender does not want to hold on to the property for a long time because of added
						expense. Appraisal- An appraisal is an unbiased opinion of value for either a purchase, refinance, or listing
						of a piece of real estate. It can be ordered by the homeowner, bank, insurance company, or other interested party
						who wants to know the market value of the property. Other uses include construction loans, insurance
						valuations, estate planning, and tax valuations. An appraisal most always includes a greater amount of information
						in the report than a CMA or BPO on the subject property as well as the surrounding neighborhood and
						community. The appraisal report contains physical data on the subject property including gross living area,
						materials of construction, and a description of its condition as well as the size of the lot it is on. Photographs
						of the exterior and interior features are included as well as items that may need repair. Information about
						the immediate neighborhood and surrounding community is also analyzed because they have a direct bearing
						on a properties value. It is important to note that both the CMA and BPO are done to estimate the anticipated list price of a
						property while an appraisal is an opinion of the likely sales price based on recent closed and pending sales,
						and taking into consideration the existing inventory of homes. The appraisal has to meet lender and underwriter
						guidelines, therefore the sales that are used have to meet certain criteria relating to time of sale,
						distance of the comparable from the subject, and percentage adjustment guidelines.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Why can you trust a license certified appraiser?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						To become a state license appraiser, we must fulfill intense education and experience requirements
						that train us to produce an unbiased opinion. Plus appraisers must stick to a strict industry code of ethics and
						comply with national standards of practice for real estate appraisals. The tenets for developing an appraisal
						and documenting its results are guaranteed by enforcement of the Uniform Standards of Professional
						Practice (USPAP). Regulations regarding licensing and certification of Real Estate Appraisers vary from state to state.
						However, licensing and certification is most often associated with many hours of classroom study, tests and
						real world experience. Once an appraiser is licensed, he or she must then take continuing education courses so
						the license remains current.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Did you know that there are 9 types of value that an appraiser can determine for you?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						While Market value may be the objective of the majority of appraisal assignments, in reality there are
						9 different types of value; all of which may produce very different conclusions. In fact, a property can
						have many different values at the same time. Lets look at the other types of value, their definitions, and
						when they would be most applicable to the scope of work in an appraisal assignment.
						Investment value is the value of a property to a specific investor’s expectations and criteria set
						forth, which is established by the appraiser to take into account the expectations of future return on investment.
						(for example to flip a property). Loan value is the amount of money a lender will loan on a particular property, it’s a percentage of
						the market value, this is expressed as a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) which is also a value to determine how to
						remove (PMI) private mtg. insurance. Insurance value it’s the amount that a property can be insured for, which is usually only the
						replacement cost of the structure, disregarding any value for the land. Insurance normally covers only the cost of the
						original building; one that is the same size and utility as the original, but built with modern materials.
						Assessed value its a percentage or ratio of the tax assesors appraised value. Although the assessor’s
						appraised value is oftentimes termed market value, its definition is most usually different from the definition
						of market value. Real estate taxes use assessed value in their calculations. (This type of report is usually
						required to determine if real estate taxes are correct).
						Liquidation value is the value of a property sold in a less than typical marketing period or with
						less-than-typical market exposure. It is useful for some court proceedings, especially bankruptcy or
						foreclosure, and for calculating worst-case scenarios in business or personal contingency plans.
						Value in Use is the value of a property to the owner as it is presently being utilized without
						considering highest and best use or present market value. If value in use is being sought for a special-use
						property (e.g. a church, a large factory where there are few comparable sales).
						Salvage value is the value of the useful components of a property that could be removed and salvaged
						before demolition. Going Concern Value is the value in use of all property; including real property and personal property
						such as trade fixtures, inventory (all tangible assets), and the intangible assets of an established and
						operating business with an indefinite life. This valuation considers what the total assets would sell for, if
						sold as one unit.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Do I get ready for the appraiser?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						After confirming an appointment and asking you a few questions before hand, such as are the utilities
						on, any recent additions that I should be aware of, any sheds, pools, guest house etc. then ask if you know
						what is the gla of your home, has the home been listed within the last 12 months either sale by owner of mls and
						what is the intended use for this appraisal assignment. When Appraiser arrives he will show his license and
						identification and give you a business card, after that, the appraisal inspection entails the following; appraiser will
						inspect the exterior first by measuring the home from the outside unless it’s a condo, then I take photos of the
						exterior front back, sides, and any pool, sheds, barns etc. then I go into the home recording the
						layout of the rooms, taking photos of each room, including photos of all mechanicals like furnace, hot water heater, electrical panel, central vacuums,
						water filtration systems, smoke detectors. Then if you are on shared wells or driveway easements, I will
						need the well agreements or the access road easement agreements with who ever you are sharing, if you are on
						septic system, I will ask when was it last serviced, I will ask for your most recent real estate tax bill.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Are some items that improve my home value?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The added value of a particular amenity truly depends on the local market area. For example if your in
						a neighborhood of small to medium priced homes, media room or a pool may not be something people in
						that price range want, so based on Theory of Substitution, which states that an informed buyer will not pay any
						more for a property or items within that property compared to another comparable similar property substitute.
						As a rule, the most value return from renovating a home comes in the kitchen (but don’t over do it).
						One recent study revealed that putting $20,000 into a kitchen remodel would add about $17,500 to the value of the
						home or about 88% return on investment a cov. Patio cost to put one in is $3000 would add $2500 a 80% return
						on investment, adding bedrooms or bathrooms can also help the value of your home, as long as your home
						doesn't then become overbuilt for your neighborhood in terms of size then it will become law of diminishing
						returns based on the theory of Contribution factor
